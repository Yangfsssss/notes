/** Item36: 使用你的问题域语言命名类型，Name Types Using Your Language of Problem Domain */

//Things to Remember
//• Reuse names from the domain of your problem where possible to increase the
//readability and level of abstraction of your code.
//• Avoid using different names for the same thing: make distinctions in names meaningful.
