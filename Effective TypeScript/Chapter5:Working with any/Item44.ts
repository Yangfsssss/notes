/** Item44: 追踪你的类型覆盖率已防止类型安全中的回归问题，Track Your Type Coverage to Prevent Regressions in Type Safety */

//Things to Remember
//• Even with noImplicitAny set, any types can make their way into your code either through explicit anys or third-party type declarations (@types).
//• Consider tracking how well-typed your program is. This will encourage you to revisit decisions about using any and increase type safety over time.
